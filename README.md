•	What your game is about (your creative theme)
My game is about saving the world! Depending on your study subject, you'll be assigned one of four classes - a hacker (Programming), a sorcerer (English), an engineer (Math, and a knight (History).


•	Which branching concepts are demonstrated where
I have various if-elif-else statements - I have if-elif-else statements checking what course load the user decides to take, the study options the user decides on, the results of the user choosing whether or not to go on the quest, and one if-else statement on whether or not the final results are printed.


•	How to run the game
The game is entirely text-run! You input your answers to the questions asked and get different results based off of that.


•	What the different endings represent
There are three endings :
1) Where you voluntarily go on the quest! You can choose to form a team, if you'd like.
2) You at first choose not to go on the quest, but then decide to do it. Here, you can also choose to form a team!
3) You do not go on the quest. That's the end of the game.


•	Any AI assistance used during development
I used ChatGPT for specific advice on where to put my if-statements, as well as better formatting one of my if--elif-else branches (the one assigning a user a class based on their choice study. These instances are listed in comments!
